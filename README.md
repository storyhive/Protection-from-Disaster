# Dua for Protection from Disasters

**اللّهُمَّ احْفَظْنَا مِنْ كُلِّ سُوءٍ وَمِصِيبَةٍ، وَنَجِّنَا مِنَ الْبَلَاءِ وَالْفِتَنِ مَا ظَهَرَ مِنْهَا وَمَا بَطَنَ**

## If the Homeland is Threatened

In the case of:

## Spy Strategy in Disguise

A spy dressed in a bald head or ascetic disguise will take up residence in the enemy's capital by calling himself a mountain dweller and taking his disciples with him. His disciples will invite the ministers to visit the ascetic.

During the meeting with the king, the spy dressed in a disguise will come to know about the king's lineage. After somehow charming the king, the spy will kill the king when he gets a suitable opportunity.

By using such and other means, the king is subdued and thrown out of his fortress or killed.
